# Tweet at the users found in the user id text file (specified in setup.py)
# Not to be run simultaneously as the find_users.py script

# Also have a streamer that replies to replies

# OK, so what's the plan?
# I want to send people tweets at times when they tend to send their offensive tweets.
# This is to magnify the impact of the kind tweet.
# We really don't want the bot getting suspended for sending unsolicited tweets to people.
# Therefore, this procedure needs to be thoroughly scrutinized before launching the actual project.

# This is perhaps not very important. The timing, I mean.
# Rather, I should focus on getting the measurement correct, while still ensuring that each person gets sent one tweet a week.
# Thus, have a week-long loop. At start, it randomly scrambles the user id list, and at a set interval tweets to the users in the list's order.
# This will make the sending of the tweets truly random, and perfectly spread out (so as to minimize the risk of violating the API restrictions).
